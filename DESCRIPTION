Description: Conduct exploratory analyses with a point-and-click interface.
    With one simple command, this tool launches a Shiny App on the
    local machine. Drag and drop variables in a data set to categorize
    them as possible independent, dependent, moderating, or mediating 
    variables. Then run dozens (or hundreds) of analyses instantly to 
    uncover any statistically significant relationships among variables.
    Any relationship thus uncovered should be tested in follow-up 
    studies. This tool is designed only to facilitate exploratory 
    analyses and should NEVER be used for p-hacking.
